Monitoring is a fundamental practice in DevOps, ensuring that applications and infrastructure are performing

optimally and issues are identified before they escalate.

So why monitoring is crucial.

First of all, uptime assurance as it ensures that critical systems and applications remain operational,

minimizing downtime then performance optimization.

It tracks resource usage, CPU memory network to optimize system performance, for example identifying

when a server is overburdened and scaling resources proactively.

And finally, early issue detection as it monitors key metrics and generates alerts when anomalies or

potential failures are detected, allowing teams to address issues before they impact users.

There are three different types of monitoring.

First, we have infrastructure monitoring.

It focuses on servers, networks, and other hardware.

It tracks metrics like CPU usage, disk space, and network latency.

We also have application monitoring.

It measures application specific metrics such as response times, error rates, or transaction counts.

And we have user experience monitoring.

It observes the end user experience, such as page load times or transaction failures to ensure user

Faction.

Imagine running an e-commerce site during a sale.

Monitoring ensures that the site can handle increased traffic.

Alerts the team if servers are overburdened and prevents a poor user experience caused by slow response

times.

In DevOps, specialized tools are used to collect, analyze, and visualize data from the systems and

applications.

So let's take a closer look at Prometheus, which is an open source tool for collecting and storing

metrics from systems and applications.

So what are the key features of Prometheus?

First of all, it collects real time metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, or application

response times.

It supports a flexible query language Promql, for analyzing metrics, and it automatically discovers

targets like servers or containers for monitoring.

And Prometheus is relatively simple to set up and integrates well with the modern DevOps environment.

However, it requires some learning to write effective queries.

Now let's take a look at Grafana, which is a powerful visualization tool for creating interactive dashboards

using data from Prometheus or other sources.

So what are the key features of Grafana?

First of all, it provides customizable dashboards for visualizing metrics like server health, database

performance, or application behavior.

It also offers alerting functionality to notify teams of issues based on defined thresholds.

And finally, it supports multiple data sources, including Prometheus, Elasticsearch, and cloud platforms.

Grafana is user friendly with an intuitive interface, but creating complex dashboards may require some

experience.

Monitoring tracks metrics while logging focuses on capturing and analyzing system and application logs

to diagnose issues and gain deeper insights.

So logging involves recording events, errors, and system message generated by software and infrastructure.

Logs provide detailed information about what occurred in the system at any given

Let's take a look at e l k stack, which is a centralized login tool.

Elk stands for Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana.

So Elasticsearch is a search engine that indexes logs for quick retrieval.

Logstash processes and transform log data for storage.

And Kibana provides visualization of logs and search capabilities.

While Elk is powerful, it's setup can be complex, requiring configuration and resource allocation.

Other tools like Fluentd or Splunk offer similar functionality with varying levels of complexity.

So what are the are the benefits of vlogging?

First of all, root cause analysis as logs provide granular details about events, helping teams quickly

identify the source of issues, then auditing and compliance as logs.

Create a record of system activity useful for security audits or meeting regulatory requirements.

And finally, debugging.

Developers use logs to understand application behavior and resolve bugs during development and production.

Imagine this during a server outage.

The logs show that a misconfigured database query caused the system to slow down and crash.

Centralized logging allows the team to quickly search for relevant logs and resolve the issue.
